# PytorchPyTorch Lightning integration with Comet

[PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the deep learning framework for professional AI researchers and machine learning engineers who need maximal flexibility without sacrificing performance at scale. Lightning evolves with you as your projects go from idea to paper/production.

Instrument PyTorch Lightning with Comet to start managing experiments, create dataset versions and track hyperparameters for faster and easier reproducibility and collaboration.


## Documentation

For more information on using and configuring the PyTorch Lightning integration, see: [https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/integrations/ml-frameworks/pytorch-lightning/](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/integrations/ml-frameworks/pytorch-lightning/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github_repo_2023&utm_content=pytorch-lightning)

## See it

Take a look at this [public Comet Project](https://www.comet.com/examples/comet-example-pytorch-lightning-optimizer/view/4oWgNi4eS5IEr3rZhM1PwzDNq/panels?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github_repo_2023&utm_content=pytorch-lightning).

## Setup

Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the example

This example shows how to use PyTorch Lightning and Comet Optimizer together to easily and efficiently find the best set of hyper-parameters for your models:


```bash
python pytorch_lightning_optimizer.py_
```
