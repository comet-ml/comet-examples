## Comet for Machine Learning Experiment Management
**Our Misson:** Comet is doing for ML what GitHub did for code. We allow data science teams to automagically track their datasets, code changes, experimentation history and production models creating efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility.

We all strive to be data driven and yet every day valuable experiment results are lost and forgotten. Comet provides a dead simple way of fixing that. It works with any workflow, any ML task, any machine, and any piece of code.

## Examples Repository

This repository contains examples of using Comet with many Machine Learning Python libraries, including fastai, torch, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, Jupyter notebooks.

If you don't see something you need, just let us know! See contact methods below.
