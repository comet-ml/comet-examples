If I’m inside the robotaxi, how can I open the doors?
From inside the robotaxi, doors can be opened and closed during pickup or drop-off using the touchscreen.
You can also press the Help icon on the touchscreen or the overhead Emergency Call Button to connect to Zoox Support. You can also call or text 1-888-477-5055.
If you need to open the doors in an emergency and the above methods do not work, you can use the Emergency Door Handle on the far left of each seat row between the side seat panel and the window. Simultaneously, pull up the handle with your left hand and push the door closest to the handle with your right hand.

Do I have to wear a seat belt?
Yes. The robotaxi won’t move until all riders are wearing their seatbelts. Please stay seated and buckled at all times, even when the robotaxi isn’t moving.
