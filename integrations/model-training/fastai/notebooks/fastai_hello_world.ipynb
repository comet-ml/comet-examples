    "# MNIST Example in fastai\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates using the **fastai** (version 1.0.38) deep learning framework with [comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we load a fastai model, called WideResNet, and train it on a small part of the MNIST_TINY dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "fastai is a framework built on top of the torch Python library.\n",

    "This example uses fastai version 1.0.38. You can install a specific version of fastai (which should also install the correct version of torch) with this command at the terminal:\n",
