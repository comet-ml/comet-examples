    "[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs) is a community and data science platform that provides tools that enable users to build, train and deploy ML models based on open source (OS) code and technologies. Primarily known for their `transformers` library, Hugging Face has helped democratized access to these models by providing a unified API to train and evaluate a number of popular models for NLP.\n",
