# Pytorch Lightning integration with Comet.ml

[PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) is the deep learning framework for professional AI researchers and machine learning engineers who need maximal flexibility without sacrificing performance at scale. Lightning evolves with you as your projects go from idea to paper/production.

Instrument PyTorch Lightning with Comet to start managing experiments, create dataset versions and track hyperparameters for faster and easier reproducibility and collaboration.
