# Optuna integration with Comet.ml

[Optuna](https://optuna.org/) is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, particularly designed for machine learning.

Log each Optuna trial to Comet to monitor in real-time the progress of your study and analyse the hyper-parameters importance, giving you full debuggability and reproducibility.
