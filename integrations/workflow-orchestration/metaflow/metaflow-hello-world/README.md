# Metaflow integration with Comet.ml

Comet integrates with [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/).

Metaflow is a human-friendly Python/R library that helps scientists and engineers build and manage real-life data science projects. Metaflow was originally developed at Netflix to boost productivity of data scientists who work on a wide variety of projects from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning.
